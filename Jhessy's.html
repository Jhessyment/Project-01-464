      <p>Hi there! I'm a current Senior and aspiring artist.
          <p>I like simple things like good food and going out on adventures. 
 I major in Computer Graphics and imaging major, which is basically CGI and 2D design merged into one.</p>
       <p> I'm also a pentacostal Christian and tangerines are my favorite fruit! 
   </p>
 <p> I can't say that I have alot of experience with any program but the ones I've been the most familiar with are:</p>
 <p>HTML and Java</p>
