<p>I am 21 years old, and I am majoring in Computer Graphics and Imaging at Lehman College. 
    I am mainly focused on living my life to the fullest and trying out new hobbies. I also enjoy spending time in nature, having fun with my friends, and being creative. 
    I hope to work in various fields in the future and travel as much as I can.</p>
