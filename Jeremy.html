<p>
    My name is Jeremy Hernandez and I am a student at Lehman College. I major in Computer Science and wish to learn
    more about full stack development. About me personally, I enjoy fitness / working out and am an adventerous person.
    I wish to be able to put both my passion for fitness and programming together to create something that will benefit others.
    I also enjoy sports, gaming, visiting new places and traveling.
